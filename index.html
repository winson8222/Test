<h3>Problem Description</h3>

<p>
    We are in the midst of a global crisis. SARS-CoV-2 (SARS CoronaVirus 2), the virus that
    causes COVID-19 has infected millions of people worldwide and killed thousands.
</p>

<p>
    In Singapore, we have implemented two systems, SafeEntry and TraceTogether. Right now,
    you are a junior developer in the team that is developing the Disease Outbreak Response Management
    System (DORMS), that brings both of these systems together. In addition, DORMS will automatically issue
    Stay-Home Notices (similar to a quarantine order).
</p>

<p>
    The actual system needs a lot of time to develop. You're in charge of completing a simulation of DORMS,
    which simulates how DORMS will operate when it has been implemented, and keeps track of statistics and
    the efficacy of the policies enacted.
</p>

<p>
    The simulation environment of DORMS is extremely complex. As such, read the following explanations carefully. 
</p>

<h3>The simulation</h3>
<h4>Viruses</h4>
<p>
   In the simulation, there are three types of viruses. All viruses spread by creating another
   virus of the same type, or another virus of a different type (mutation). Here
   is how each virus spreads:
   <ul>
     <li>AlphaCoronavirus: Every time it spreads, it has some probability of mutating into SARS-CoV-2.
     In the event that it doesn't mutate, the virus will simply create another AlphaCoronavirus,
     but the probability of that new virus mutating is reduced by 10% (given by <tt>SimulationParameters#VIRUS_MUTATION_PROBABILITY_REDUCTION</tt>).</li>
     <li>
        SARS-CoV-2: This is the target virus of the simulation, and this causes COVID-19. Every time
        it spreads, it has some probability of mutating into a BetaCoronavirus. In the event that it
        doesn't mutate, the probability of that new virus mutating is reduced by 10%.
     </li>
     <li>
        BetaCoronavirus: This virus has no probability of mutating. As such, every time it spreads, it
        simply creates another BetaCoronavirus.
     </li>
   </ul>
</p>

<h4>People</h4>
<p>
    Of course, people are the key of this simulation, who
    are the primary vectors of the viruses above. People
    can transmit (give out) viruses they have, and can be
    infected with (take in) viruses from a contact. This
    simulation concerns itself with two types of people:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Person: Represents the average person like you
            and me. When transmitting viruses, the person
            will transmit all the viruses he/she is
            infected with.
        </li>
        <li>
            MaskedPerson: This person is wearing a mask. 
            In the simulation, masks are 60% effective
            (given by <tt>SimulationParameters#MASK_EFFECTIVENESS</tt>).
            This means that there is a 60% chance that at
            any given contact, no viruses will be transmitted.
            Likewise, there is a 60% chance that at any
            given contact, this person will not be infected
            with any virus.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h4>DORMS</h4>
<p>
    As a junior developer, you are not required to implement the full solution yourself.
    The higher level classes have already been implemented
    for you. All you need to do is to implement the concrete
    classes that represent different entities of the
    simulation. However, for clarity, the following explains
    how DORMS works and provides some specifications for
    you as you complete the implementation.
</p>

<p>
    DORMS is essentially a combination of two existing
    solutions:
    <ul>
        <li>SafeEntry: This is a system that allows users
            to check in and out of different locations.
            This allows us to keep track of all the
            contacts made in a location, to prevent and
            control the transmission of diseases and 
            identify disease clusters. With SafeEntry, it
            is assumed that a person entering a location
            makes contact with everyone in that location,
            and diseases are spread via each contact.
        </li>
        <li> TraceTogether: This is a programme to enhance
            Singapore's contact tracing efforts. The 
            TraceTogether app is a mobile application that
            uses bluetooth to detect other nearby 
            TraceTogether-enabled devices. On device
            detection, it is assumed that contact is made
            and diseases are spread via that contact.
        </li>
    </ul>

    Given these two systems, DORMS is a single platform
    that interacts with both of these systems for contact
    tracing. It allows users to check in to a location
    (via <tt>checkIn</tt>), check out of a location
    (via <tt>checkOut</tt>), keeps track of other contacts
    for TraceTogether (via <tt>contact</tt>). It also
    notes any person who presents with symptoms of
    respiratory illnesses (via <tt>presentSymptoms</tt>).
    DORMS will conduct a serological test on anyone
    who presents themselves with these symptoms, and take
    the necessary action if the person tests positive for
    the target virus (SARS-CoV-2). The following describes
    the action that needs to be taken by DORMS on a
    positive SARS-CoV-2 test:
    <ol>
        <li>
            The person who tested positive will be given
            a 28-day Stay-Home-Notice and will not be
            allowed to leave their home during that period.
        </li>
        <li>
            All recent (14 days, or
            <tt>SimulationParameters#TRACING_PERIOD</tt>)
            contacts made by this person will be served
            a 14-day (or <tt>SimulationParameters#SHN_DURATION</tt>) Stay-Home-Notice as well.
        </li>
    </ol>
    However, the current implementation of DORMS does
    not support it, but thanks to SOLID principles, the
    developers of DORMS have made it open for
    extension, and it will be simple to implement this
    behaviour.
</p>

<h3>Your Task</h3>

<p>
    You are given the incomplete implementation of the DORMS simulation.
    Your task is to complete the implementation of the
    missing classes.
</p>

<p>
    After completing the program, you may run the
    DORMS simulation:
    <pre>$ java Main
===== RUNNING SIMULATION =====
Mask policy not implemented and SHN not issued

===== STATISTICS =====
Infected population: 11
Total Population: 19
===== SIMULATION COMPLETED =====

===== RUNNING SIMULATION =====
Mask policy not implemented and SHN issued

===== STATISTICS =====
Infected population: 6
Total Population: 19
===== SIMULATION COMPLETED =====

===== RUNNING SIMULATION =====
Mask policy implemented and SHN not issued

===== STATISTICS =====
Infected population: 7
Total Population: 19
===== SIMULATION COMPLETED =====

===== RUNNING SIMULATION =====
Mask policy implemented and SHN issued

===== STATISTICS =====
Infected population: 4
Total Population: 19
===== SIMULATION COMPLETED =====


</pre>
</p>

<p>
    Or you can run the simulation in verbose mode
    by issuing the <tt>-v</tt> flag, such as by running <tt>java Main -v</tt>
</p>

<p>
    This task is divided into several levels. 
    Read through all the levels to see how the different levels are related. 
    You are to complete <strong>ALL</strong> levels.
</p>

<p>
    All the files given to you should not be modified. You
    may modify them for your own testing, but we will replace
    them to conduct our own tests on your solutions.

<p>
  <big><strong>Creating the immutable Virus class</strong></big>
</p>

<p>
    The first thing we'd define is the Virus class, because
    most of the entities of this simulation relies on
    its implementation.
</p>

<p>
  We are going to define a <tt>Virus</tt> class where each virus will
  inherit from. This follows the Open-Closed and Liskov Substitution Principles nicely,
  and subsequently, you'll observe that these will come in handy when viruses are being spread for person to person.
</p>

<p>
  The <tt>Virus</tt> class will have attributes depending on your implementation.
    However, your supervisor has instructed you ensure 
    that your <tt>Virus</tt> class has the following
    methods that adhere to the following specifications:
    <ul>
        <li><tt>Virus spread(double random)</tt>. This
            method essentially causes the virus to
            spread, returning a new virus. It takes in 
            a <tt>random</tt> value as a <tt>double</tt>.
            Essentially, if <tt>random &lt;= probabilityOfMutating</tt>, then the virus mutates.
        </li>
        <li><tt>boolean test(String name)</tt>. This
            method essentially checks if this virus has
            <tt>name</tt> as its name. The method will be
            used for the serological tests conducted.</li>
        <li>The string representation of virus objects
            is shown in the jshell output</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    Note that by SOLID principles, you should have aimed
    to keep <tt>Virus</tt> abstract and implement
    concrete <tt>AlphaCoronavirus</tt>, <tt>BetaCoronavirus</tt> and <tt>SARS_CoV_2</tt> classes.
    Note the naming, especially with <tt>SARS_CoV_2</tt> where we use a small 'o'. Note that the name of the virus is spelt with - instead of _; we use _ as the name of the class instead, for obvious reasons.

<big><strong>Representing People</strong></big>
</p>

<p>
    Now, we are going to implement a <strong>mutable</strong> <tt>Person</tt> class.
</p>

<p>
    These are the specifications for the <tt>Person</tt> class:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <tt>transmit(double random)</tt> is a method
            that returns the list of the viruses to
            transmit after spreading, where <tt>random</tt>
            is used to determine if each virus mutates or not. You should be able to infer the return type.
        </li>
        <li>
            <tt>void infectWith(SomeType listOfViruses, double random)</tt>.
            This is a method that causes the person to
            be infected with the listOfViruses. You 
            should be able to determine what <tt>SomeType</tt> is. Note that for this method, the <tt>random</tt> value is insignificant because the viruses
            do not mutate before entering the human body,
            but only when exiting.
        </li>
        <li>
            The <tt>String</tt> representation and constructor

  <big><strong>Making Contact</strong></big>
</p>

<p>
    Now we are going to get two people to contact
    each other and spread viruses.
</p>

<p>
    Create an <strong>immutable</strong> <tt>Contact</tt> 
    class that keeps track of a contact between two people,
    and transmits viruses between them. Note that the
    viruses should be transmitted immediately upon
    the instantiation of the <tt>Contact</tt> object.
</p>

<p>
    The following are the specifications of the <tt>Contact</tt> class:
    <ul>
        <li><tt>Contact(Person first, Person second, double time)</tt>. This is the constructor which keeps
            the references of the two people in contact, 
            while simultaneously transmitting viruses between each other. Note that the transmission and infection of viruses happen in parallel, meaning that a infects b at the same time that b infects a. Also, the random value should be determined by <tt>RandomNumberGenerator</tt> (see <tt>RandomNumberGenerator#nextDouble</tt>).</li>
        <li>
            <tt>boolean involves(Person p, double time)</tt>.

        <li><tt>Person other(Person p)</tt>. This method
            simply returns the other <tt>Person</tt> involved
            in the contact. Assume that <tt>p</tt> will
            always be a valid member of the contact.

        <li>

  <big><strong>Mask Policy</strong></big>
</p>
<p>
    We are aiming to simulate the efficacy of a mask-wearing policy.
    As such, we need some way to represent the behaviour
    of people wearing masks.
</p>

<p>
    Hopefully, you have kept your <tt>Person</tt> class
    open for extension. As such, we can quite simply extend
    from the <tt>Person</tt> class to create a
    <tt>MaskedPerson</tt> class, which follows the
    same specifications.
</p>

<p>
    Note that for both transmissions and infections, if
    the random value supplied is less than or equal to 
    the mask's effectiveness (see <tt>SimulationParameters#MASK_EFFECTIVENESS</tt>),
    then nothing is transmitted / infected.
</p>

<p>
    The remaining specifications can be inferred from
    the jshell test. Note that you should adhere to the
    DRY (Don't-Repeat-Yourself) principle as much as
    possible. Expect to make calls to <tt>super</tt> in

  <big><strong>Stay-Home-Notice (SHN) Policy</strong></big>
</p>
<p>
    We are aiming to simulate the efficacy of an SHN policy. Because DORMS currently does not support this,
    we need to extend the <tt>Dorms</tt> class to
    implement this behaviour.
</p>

<p>
    Because we need to keep track of SHNs being given
    out, we can use the <tt>Person</tt> class to maintain
    the state of each <tt>Person</tt>, i.e. whether he/she
    is on SHN. This results in two new methods required
    in the class:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <tt>boolean serveSHN(double shnEndTime)</tt>.
            This issues the person an SHN that ends at
            <tt>shnEndTime</tt>. The method returns <tt>true</tt> only if an SHN was served; if <tt>Person A</tt>
            is serving an SHN until time <tt>t = 10</tt>,
            and is now issued a second SHN that ends at
            time <tt>t = 9</tt>, then the second SHN is not
            issued as it makes no difference.
        </li>
        <li>
            <tt>boolean onSHN(double currentTime)</tt>.
            This takes in the current time and returns
            <tt>true</tt> if the <tt>Person</tt> is on SHN.
        </li>
    </ul>

</p>

<p>
Your job now is to implement the <tt>DormsWithShn</tt> class
which is basically DORMS + automatic issuance of SHNs.
Remember that you are not allowed to modify the <tt>Dorms</tt> class. Many methods were purposefully declared <tt>final</tt> to prevent extension.
</p>

<p>
    Read the remaining classes provided to you carefully.
    In particular, here are some tips to help you
    implement the feature:
    <ul>
        <li>The main logic you need to override is <tt>handleSickPerson</tt>. You do not need to override
        other methods or define other behaviours.</li>
        <li>
            The constructor for <tt>DormsWithShn</tt>
            class should be the same as <tt>Dorms</tt>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make use of the <tt>queryContacts</tt> method.
            This retrieves all the <tt>Contact</tt>s that
            are related to the sick <tt>Person</tt>.
            This also queries the <tt>Contacts</tt> up to
            <tt>SimulationParameters#TRACING_PERIOD</tt>
            in history.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remember to log every SHN served. The format
            of the output can be seen in the verbose output
            of the simulation below. Do not use <tt>System.out.println()</tt>, but use <tt>log</tt> instead.
        </li>
        <li>
            The behaviour of people checking in or making
            contact while on SHN is well defined. You do
            not need to implement this behaviour.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    Once you're done with the implementation, you may
    proceed to run the DORMS simulation by compiling 
    <tt>Main.java</tt> and running <tt>Main</tt> on the
    JVM. You may also supply the <tt>-v</tt> flag for
    verbose mode, which shows all your logs.
</p>
<p>We hope you enjoyed this mock PE, best of luck for
    next Friday :)
</p>

<p>
    One final question, do you think DORMS was well designed?
    How can we improve the design of DORMS?
